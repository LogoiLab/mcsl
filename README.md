# Minecraft Server Locator

This tool takes the output of masscan and attempts to use the Minecraft server status query API to gather and save details about a suspected Minecraft server.

You will need a lot of `xsv`, `sed`, `awk`, and other "glue programs" to use this properly.

Eventually I will make this application fully integrated.
